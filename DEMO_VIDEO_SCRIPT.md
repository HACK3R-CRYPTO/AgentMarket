## [0:00-0:20] Introduction & The Problem

**[Screen: Split screen - showing 5 different apps open]**

"Web3 users waste hours every day switching between 5+ different apps. Check prices on CoinGecko. Swap on VVS. Transfer via wallet. Query on Cronoscan. Analyze contracts separately."

**[Screen: Close all apps, show OneChat homepage]**

"Each app. Different login. Different interface. 15+ minutes for simple tasks. What if you could do ALL of this in ONE chat?"

**[Screen: Show beginner confusion - terms like "DEX", "slippage", "gas fees" with question marks]**

"But here's the bigger problem - Web3 is intimidating. 'Gas fees', 'slippage tolerance', 'contract addresses', 'chain IDs'. These terms scare away 99% of potential users. A complete beginner like Lisa has never used crypto. She doesn't know what a DEX is. She doesn't understand slippage or gas fees. She just wants to save money. But traditional Web3 tools require a PhD in Computer Science just to get started."

**[Screen: OneChat logo/hero section]**

"Welcome to OneChat - a Web3 assistant platform with two powerful modes. Unified chat interface where you ask anything in plain English. And an AI agent marketplace where developers create specialized agents and users execute them. Both powered by Cronos and x402 micropayments. AI-driven contract interactions. Agent-triggered payments. Automated settlement workflows. And here's the key - you don't need to learn Web3 jargon. Just ask in plain English, or browse specialized agents."

---

## [0:20-0:50] Wallet Connection & x402 Agent-Triggered Payments

**[Screen: Connect wallet page]**

"First, let's connect your wallet. I'm using MetaMask. Switch to Cronos Testnet."

**[Screen: Wallet connected, navigate to /chat]**

"Now we're in unified chat - this is where the magic happens."

**[Screen: Chat interface - empty state with Quick Actions]**

"See these quick actions? One-click shortcuts for common tasks. But let's start with a simple question."

**[Screen: Type "What's the price of Bitcoin?"]**

"Let me ask: What's the price of Bitcoin?"

**[Screen: Show response with real-time price]**

"Real-time price from Crypto.com Market Data MCP Server. No CoinGecko needed. No app switching. Just ask."

**[Screen: Show x402 payment prompt - highlight agent-triggered payment]**

"Watch this - x402 agent-triggered payment. The AI agent detected the query, triggered the payment flow automatically. Pay $0.10 via x402 micropayment. No subscription. Pay only for what you use. This is agent-triggered payment automation in action."

---

## [0:50-1:20] Portfolio View & Automated Settlement

**[Screen: Type "Show my portfolio"]**

"Show my portfolio."

**[Screen: Show portfolio view with all tokens]**

"System fetches all my token balances from Cronos blockchain. Everything in one place. Real on-chain data."

**[Screen: Show payment prompt and settlement]**

"x402 payment automatically triggered. Payment verified. Settlement processed. All automated. This is the x402 Agentic Finance track - automated settlement pipelines with AI-driven workflows."

**[Screen: Show formatted portfolio with all tokens]**

"Complete portfolio view. All tokens. All balances. One chat. Automated settlement. No manual steps."

---

## [1:20-1:50] Individual Agents Marketplace - Browse and Execute

**[Screen: Navigate to homepage]**

"OneChat has two powerful modes. We've seen unified chat. Now let's explore the individual agents marketplace. This is equally important."

**[Screen: Show agent cards with execution counts]**

"Browse agents on the homepage. Each agent has a specialization. Smart Contract Analyzer. Content Generator. Market Data Agent. Portfolio Analyzer. See those execution counts? Real-time metrics from blockchain. Each agent shows its price and description."

**[Screen: Click on Smart Contract Analyzer]**

"Let's use the Smart Contract Analyzer. This is a specialized agent that focuses only on contract analysis. Click on the agent to view its details page."

**[Screen: Show agent detail page]**

"Agent details page shows full description, pricing, execution history, and developer info. This agent analyzes Solidity code for vulnerabilities."

**[Screen: Type contract code]**

"Provide your input - paste Solidity contract code here."

**[Screen: Click Execute button]**

"Click Execute. Now watch the payment flow - this is where it gets interesting."

**[Screen: Show x402 payment flow]**

"User pays $0.10 via x402. Payment goes to escrow contract. Backend executes the agent. Backend settles payment automatically. Backend releases payment to developer. Platform takes 10% fee. Developer receives 90% in their wallet. All automatic. All on-chain. All transparent."

**[Screen: Show analysis response]**

"Security report generated by the specialized agent. Focused, quality results."

**[Screen: Show agent metrics updating]**

"See the execution count update? Real-time metrics from blockchain. Developers earn revenue from every execution. This is the x402 Applications track - agent-triggered payments with automated settlement."

---

## [1:50-2:15] Developer Portal - Create Your Own Agent

**[Screen: Navigate to /dashboard]**

"Now here's the developer portal. This is where developers create their own specialized agents and earn revenue."

**[Screen: Show "Create Agent" form]**

"Let's create a new agent. Fill in the name - let's call it 'NFT Metadata Analyzer'. Description - what it does and its specialization. Price - set price per execution, let's say $0.25."

**[Screen: Fill form and submit]**

"Submit the form. Agent details are registered on-chain in the Agent Registry smart contract."

**[Screen: Show agent registered on blockchain]**

"Agent registered on Cronos blockchain. Smart contract stores the agent details. On-chain registry. Transparent. Immutable. No smart contract deployment needed from developers."

**[Screen: Show agent in marketplace]**

"Agent appears in marketplace immediately. Users can browse, search, and execute. Every execution triggers x402 payment. Developer earns 90% of payment. Platform takes 10% fee. All automatic. All transparent. This is the x402 Applications track - AI-driven contract interactions with automated payment settlement and developer revenue model."

---

## [2:15-2:40] VVS Finance Integration & Multi-Step Workflows

**[Screen: Go back to unified chat]**

"Both modes work together. Unified chat can route to individual agents when appropriate. Let's go back to unified chat and try VVS Finance integration."

**[Screen: Type "Swap 100 CRO for USDC"]**

"Swap 100 CRO for USDC."

**[Screen: Show live quote from VVS Finance]**

"System detects swap intent. Fetches live quote from VVS Finance DEX. Returns expected output amount and swap path."

**[Screen: Show swap parameters]**

"Swap parameters ready. This is Crypto.com X Cronos Ecosystem Integration - VVS Finance intelligent swap routing with x402-powered settlement."

**[Screen: Show x402 payment for swap execution]**

"Execute via x402 payment. $0.15 for swap execution. Agent-driven workflow. Automated liquidity actions. Multi-step transaction with automated settlement. This is the x402 Agentic Finance track - multi-leg transactions and batching with risk-managed workflows."

---

## [2:40-2:55] Beginner-Friendly: Plain English Queries

**[Screen: Type "What is USDC and how do I get some?"]**

"Now let's see how a complete beginner would use OneChat. Lisa has never used crypto before. She doesn't know what USDC is. She just types: What is USDC and how do I get some?"

**[Screen: Show AI response explaining USDC in plain English with current price]**

"The AI explains what USDC is in plain English. Shows the current price. Guides her step-by-step. All for just $0.10. No technical jargon. No confusing terms. Just clear, helpful explanations."

**[Screen: Type "Swap 50 CRO for USDC"]**

"When she's ready, she asks: Swap 50 CRO for USDC."

**[Screen: Show swap quote and execution]**

"System handles all the technical details automatically. No need to understand slippage. No need to configure gas fees. No need to navigate DEX interfaces. She just signs the transaction. She uses Web3 without ever needing to learn Web3 jargon. That's the power of OneChat - making Web3 accessible to everyone."

---

## [2:55-3:10] Token Wrap with Modal & Automated Settlement

**[Screen: Type "Wrap 1 CRO token"]**

"Wrap 1 CRO token."

**[Screen: Show magic link in response]**

"System generates a magic link using Crypto.com Developer Platform SDK."

**[Screen: Click link - MODAL OPENS (not new tab!)]**

"Modal overlay! Not a new tab. Transaction form appears right here in the chat."

**[Screen: Show transaction form in modal]**

"Complete the transaction without leaving chat. x402 payment automatically triggered. Settlement processed. Automated workflow. No app switching. Seamless experience."

**[Screen: Close modal]**

"That's the power of modal overlays with automated settlement. Everything stays in one place. Everything automated."

---

## [3:10-3:25] Technical Highlights - Track Alignment

**[Screen: Split screen - show chat + backend logs or architecture]**

"Here's what makes OneChat special and how it aligns with all three hackathon tracks:"

**[Text overlay appears - Track 1: x402 Applications]**

"Track 1 - x402 Applications:

- **User-focused version (2 min)**: More problem/solution, less technical details
- **Developer version (3 min)**: Emphasize dashboard, agent creation, revenue tracking, on-chain registration

### Key Moments to Emphasize:
1. **Opening** - The problem (multiple apps, time waste, jargon barrier)
2. **Agent-triggered payments** - x402 automatically triggered by AI agents
3. **Individual agents marketplace** - Browse, execute, see revenue model (Track 1)
4. **Developer portal** - Developers create agents, earn revenue (Track 1)
5. **Automated settlement** - Multi-step payment workflows (Track 2)
6. **VVS Finance integration** - Crypto.com X Cronos ecosystem (Track 3)
7. **Beginner-friendly** - Plain English queries, no jargon needed
8. **Modal overlay** - Seamless UX, no tab switching
9. **Closing** - Before/after comparison (15 min → 2 min) + track alignment
